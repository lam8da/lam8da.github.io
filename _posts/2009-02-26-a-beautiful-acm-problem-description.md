niubility~！学东西了：

Fleeting time does not blur my memory of you. Can it really be 4 years since I
first saw you? I still remember, vividly, on the beautiful Zhuhai Campus, 4
years ago, from the moment I saw you smile, as you were walking out of the
classroom and turned your head back, with the soft sunset glow shining on your
rosy cheek, I knew, I knew that I was already drunk on you. Then, after several
months’ observation and prying, your grace and your wisdom, your attitude to
life and your aspiration for future were all strongly impressed on my memory.
You were the glamorous and sunny girl whom I always dream of to share the rest
of my life with. Alas, actually you were far beyond my wildest dreams and I had
no idea about how to bridge that gulf between you and me. So I schemed nothing
but to wait, to wait for an appropriate opportunity. Till now — the arrival of
graduation, I realize I am such an idiot that one should create the opportunity
and seize it instead of just waiting.
These days, having parted with friends, roommates and classmates one after
another, I still cannot believe the fact that after waving hands, these familiar
faces will soon vanish from our life and become no more than a memory. I will
move out from school tomorrow. And you are planning to fly far far away, to
pursue your future and fulfill your dreams. Perhaps we will not meet each other
any more if without fate and luck. So tonight, I was wandering around your
dormitory building hoping to meet you there by chance. But contradictorily, your
appearance must quicken my heartbeat and my clumsy tongue might be not able to
belch out a word. I cannot remember how many times I have passed your dormitory
building both in Zhuhai and Guangzhou , and each time aspired to see you appear
in the balcony or your silhouette that cast on the window. I cannot remember how
many times this idea comes to my mind: call her out to have dinner or at least a
conversation. But each time, thinking of your excellence and my commonness, the
predominance of timidity over courage drove me leave silently.

Graduation, means the end of life in university, the end of these glorious,
romantic years. Your lovely smile which is my original incentive to work hard
and this unrequited love will be both sealed as a memory in the deep of my heart
and my mind. Graduation, also means a start of new life, a footprint on the way
to bright prospect. I truly hope you will be happy everyday abroad and
everything goes well. Meanwhile, I will try to get out from puerility and become
more sophisticated. To pursue my own love and happiness here in reality will be
my ideal I never desert.

Farewell, my princess!

If someday, somewhere, we have a chance to gather, even as gray-haired man and
woman, at that time, I hope we can be good friends to share this memory proudly
to relight the youthful and joyful emotions. If this chance never comes, I wish
I were the stars in the sky and twinkling in your window, to bless you far away,
as friends, to accompany you every night, sharing the sweet dreams or going
through the nightmares together.

我加了一些注释后：

Fleeting（转瞬即逝的） time does not blur（模糊） my memory of you. Can it
really be 4 years since I first saw you? I still remember,
vividly（清晰地，生动鲜明地）, on the beautiful Zhuhai Campus, 4 years ago, from
the moment I saw you smile, as you were walking out of the classroom and turned
your head back, with the soft sunset glow（温柔的落日的余晖） shining on your
rosy cheek（玫瑰色的脸颊）, I knew, I knew that I was already drunk（陶醉） on
you. Then, after several months’ observation and prying（窥探）, your
grace（风度，优雅） and your wisdom（学识，智慧）, your attitude to life and
your aspiration（渴望，憧憬） for future were all strongly impressed on my
memory. You were the glamorous（有魅力的，迷人的） and sunny girl whom I always
dream of to share the rest of my life with. Alas（唉。。）, actually you were
far beyond my wildest dreams（我最漫无边际的梦想） and I had no idea about how
to bridge that gulf between you and
me（在你我之间的海湾架起一座桥，即弥合你和我）. So I schemed（计划） nothing but
to wait, to wait for an appropriate（适当的） opportunity. Till now — the
arrival of graduation, I realize I am such an idiot（白痴） that one should
create the opportunity and seize（抓住） it instead of just waiting.

These days, having parted with friends, roommates and classmates one after
another, I still cannot believe the fact that after waving hands, these familiar
faces will soon vanish（消失） from our life and become no more than a memory. I
will move out from school tomorrow. And you are planning to fly far far away, to
pursue（继续，追赶） your future and fulfill（实现，履行） your dreams. Perhaps
we will not meet each other any more if without fate and luck. So tonight, I was
wandering around your dormitory building hoping to meet you there by chance. But
contradictorily（矛盾地）, your appearance must quicken my heartbeat （心跳）and
my clumsy（笨拙的） tongue might be not able to belch out（喷出） a word. I
cannot remember how many times I have passed your dormitory building both in
Zhuhai and Guangzhou , and each time aspired to see you appear in the
balcony（阳台） or your silhouette（轮廓） that cast（投影） on the window. I
cannot remember how many times this idea comes to my mind: call her out to have
dinner or at least a conversation. But each time, thinking of your excellence
and my commonness（平凡）, the predominance（优势） of timidity（胆怯） over
courage drove me leave silently.

Graduation, means the end of life in university, the end of these
glorious（光荣的）, romantic years. Your lovely smile which is my original
incentive（动力、动机，激励的） to work hard and this unrequited（无报答的）
love will be both sealed（封存） as a memory in the deep of my heart and my
mind. Graduation, also means a start of new life, a footprint（足迹，脚印） on
the way to bright prospect（景色，希望，前途）. I truly hope you will be happy
everyday abroad and everything goes well. Meanwhile, I will try to get out from
puerility（幼稚，天真） and become more sophisticated（老练的）. To pursue my
own love and happiness here in reality will be my ideal（理想） I never
desert（放弃，遗弃）.

Farewell（别了，再见）, my princess!

If someday, somewhere, we have a chance to gather（相遇，聚集）, even as
gray-haired man and woman, at that time, I hope we can be good friends to share
this memory proudly to relight the youthful and joyful（令人高兴的，欢喜的）
emotions. If this chance never comes, I wish I were the stars in the sky and
twinkling（闪耀） in your window, to bless you far away, as friends, to
accompany（伴随） you every night, sharing the sweet dreams or going through the
nightmares（梦魇） together.
