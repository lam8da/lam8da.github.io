$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

\\[ \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{P^\mathsf{T}} \\]

If you want to use subscripts you **don\'t** need to scape the
underscores with a backslash like:

$$ \mathbf{X}_{n,p} = \mathbf{A}_{n,k} \mathbf{B}\_{k,p} $$

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and
re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many
different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches
a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the
convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front
matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it
works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
